STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!

Services finished:

	codepad.org
	pastebin.com
	pastebin.org


Elmer is robust frontend to wget, curl, and perl's LWP for pastebin services.
It supports (or will support) all of the major services and languages for those services,
along with the other options that are easier to implement, such as private, run, and expiration,
as well as a few lesser known services plus omploader and my own unreliable image paste (sudokode.net),
which support more than just text/code.

The real purpose of elmer is to move all of the simple scripts out there into one perl script that can
support a number of methods to paste stuff. Thus there is no reason to, for example, install curl and
lua to use curlpaste just because it supports a service you like instead of wgetpaste, even though wgetpaste is
more portable since it uses bash and the more prevalent wget. Another example is the ompload program to paste to
omploader, which requires ruby. Since elmer uses perl and three different pasting methods, plus supports many
more services, it should be easier to install by end users or to include in your distro's base system.

Eventually, elmer will be much more portable, support more services, and allow for easier judgment on which
paste method to use. For now, it's a simple hobby project of mine, though still useful, especially to me.
